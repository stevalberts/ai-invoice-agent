    "\n",
    "Invoice processing represents a critical financial operation characterized by high volume, repetitive tasks, and stringent accuracy requirements. Traditional approaches to automation have focused on rule-based systems and optical character recognition (OCR) technologies with limited contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal understanding, have created opportunities for developing autonomous agents capable of handling the full invoice lifecycle with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "This paper explores the architectural foundations of autonomous invoice processing systems with a focus on AI agent architectures that can perceive, reason, and act within financial workflows. We examine both the theoretical understandings and practical implementations of these systems, highlighting key technological advancements that have enabled the transition to truly autonomous processing."
